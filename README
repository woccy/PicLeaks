# Requirements

Apache Server 2.2
PHP 5.2.4 or greater
MySQL v5.0 or greater

# Optional requirements

XAMPP / WAMP Server environment for developing locally
(alternative is to use your own web server or shared hosting)

# for installation see INSTALL

## Instructions for obtaining the latest code and developing it

# create your local fork by clicking 'Fork' (located on the upper right corner of this page)

# go to the root folder of your web server:

cd www

# clone the repo from private URL (remember to have your SSH key(s) added under "Account Settings")
# this point will be called origin (you can rename it later, if you want)

# git clone git@github.com:<user_name>/PicLeaks.git

create an upstream remote from public URL

cd PicLeaks
git remote add upstream git://github.com/<user_name>/PicLeaks.git

# fetch the latest upstream content
# if you haven't developed for awhile, remember to fetch, otherwise it's not necessary

git fetch upstream

# code something!
# don't forget to commit your changes

git commit -am "<your comments?>"

# then push the staged area code to your fork
# git push <remote_name> <branch_name>

git push origin master
